# IBS-Tracker

Developed in 24 hours, this app was first created during the StarterHacks 2020 hackathon. Targetted towards users with IBS or IBS-like symptoms, this app allows the user to track key things such as the type and amount of food, meal size, supplements, IBS symptoms, and bowel movements and connects them all to a specific date. This allows the user to have a better understanding of how their body is affected by different choices they make and allows them to then use this information to better manage their IBS.
